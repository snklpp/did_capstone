**Capstone Project â€“ Long-life Verifiable Credentials with Decentralized Identifiers (Ongoing)**

* Designing a **decentralized credentialing system** using **DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** to ensure lifelong validity, tamper resistance, and interoperability.
* Implementing **ION (Identity Overlay Network)** on Bitcoin via Sidetree for DID creation, authentication key rotation, recovery operations, and secure anchoring.
* Addressing challenges of **key compromise, issuer dependency, and credential reissuance** by enabling **key rotation and recovery without central authority**.
- **Embedding key rotation facility, involving**
  - Authentication key (for signing & authentication)
  - Update key (for authentication key rotation)
  - Recovery Key (for update key rotation)
